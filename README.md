Entities and Builders
=====================

This library provides convenient classes for creating
immutable model objects from complex builders.


# Versions

This version combines ideas from previous builder modules
from various BC projects. While the API is stabilizing, releases
will be called 0.x. No compatibilities between versions
with that pattern can be assumed.

The first release with a stable API will be called 1.x and versions
released with that pattern will be backward compatible with
any other 1.x version having smaller x.
